Introduction
Welcome to the Rust File Server Interaction project! This project is a collaborative effort by Arnav, Aryan, Amey, and Pranav, under the guidance of Professor Kunal Korgaonkarr. The aim of this project is to create a robust file server interaction system in Rust, highlighting its advantages over a similar implementation in the C programming language.

Project Description
The project focuses on developing a client-server interaction system for file servers using the Rust programming language. The server is designed to handle file operations, such as reading, writing, and deleting files, while the client interacts with the server to perform these operations.

Features
Secure Communication: The communication between the client and server is secured to prevent unauthorized access.

File Operations: The system supports essential file operations, including reading, writing, and deleting files.

Concurrency: Rust's ownership system and concurrency features are utilized to ensure efficient and safe concurrent access to the server.

Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling is implemented to provide meaningful feedback to users in case of issues.

Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/rust-file-server.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd rust-file-server
Follow the instructions in the INSTALL.md file for installation.
Usage
Detailed usage instructions can be found in the USAGE.md file. Make sure to review this document to understand how to use the client-server interaction system effectively.

Comparison with C
This project aims to showcase the advantages of Rust over C in the context of file server interactions. Some key points of comparison include:

Memory Safety: Rust's ownership system helps prevent common memory-related issues, providing a safer environment compared to C.

Concurrency: Rust's ownership and borrowing system facilitates easy and safe implementation of concurrency, enhancing performance without sacrificing safety.

Error Handling: Rust's Result type and exhaustive pattern matching make error handling more explicit and manageable compared to C's error codes.
